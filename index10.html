    <p>Why don't we directly access elements using only id:</p>
    <p>While using IDs for directly accessing elements can be convenient in some cases, it's not always the best approach 
        <br><br>
        1: According to HTML specifications, IDs must be unique within the document. If you have multiple elements with the same ID,it  can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. On the other hand, classes can be applied to multiple elements, making them suitable for styling or selecting groups of elements.
        <br><br>
        2: Using IDs throughout your codebase can make it harder to maintain and restructuring  your code.If you decide to change the structure of your HTML or rename elements, you'll need to update all references to those IDs in your JavaScript code.
