    <p>Difference between document.children and Other Selection Methods:</p>
    <p>document.children specifically targets direct child elements of the html root element, the other selection methods (querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName) allow you to select elements based on various standard like CSS selectors, tag names, or class names, providing more flexibility in DOM manipulation tasks. Additionally, querySelector and querySelectorAll return single elements or collections of elements based on CSS selectors, while the others return collections of elements based on tag name or class name.</p>
